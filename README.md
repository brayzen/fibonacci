Fibonacci numbers

Assignment was to calculate as many fibonacci numbers as possible.  Created two files...one with class Fibonacci and the other with the test file to run the class Fibonacci.

It has a few different methods.....Run, Start, Stop and Continue.  Really Start and continue are the functional methods.

First approach was storing an ever increasing array.  We thought our result of 300_000 iterations was solid.  Then considering Big O, we decided to chop of the array for only the last two numbers in the array and then reassigning the array.  This resulted in more than double our iterations at roughly 600_000+.

Feeling confident we have won.
